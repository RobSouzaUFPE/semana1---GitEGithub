# __Primeira Atvidade__
<br>

### __My READEME__
<br>
<p> The challenge proposed in this activity took into account all the content covered in the last class on 08/13/2022, code versioning with Git and GITHUB. The Tool used during the synchronous class fo GIT BASH, in which Loui showed how to use various commands.
<p> In this way, the objective of this first activity is to use everything that we absorb during the class, test our learning and go a little further, starting with the construction of a file in Markdown language.
<p>I must clarify that the summaries below express the student's understanding of the activity and may at some point be changed or corrected if necessary.
<p> For this, some texts (links) were made available for reading and summary:
<br>
<br>
1.[*Qual a diferença entre Framework e Biblioteca ?*](https://www.treinaweb.com.br/blog/qual-a-diferenca-entre-framework-e-biblioteca)
2.[*Como a internet funciona?*](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
3. [*O que é possível*](https://tecnoblog.net/responde/o-que-e-algoritmo/)
<br>

### __Summary of texts__
<br>

# __Text One__
<br>
<p>The first text is very interesting, because it addresses the difference between the framework and the library in a very simple way and with the use of examples.
<p>After reading, I understood that the framework is something more structured, with a flow that must be followed. I'll try to bring what I imagined graphically. Let's think that the framework is a pretty cool box, ready to build something for the web...
<p>So, the pieces are already there, it is not so simple to make adaptations, we must use the available resources in our construction.
<p>While libraries are not a complete box of solutions where we can build a solution. They are simpler, composed of codes that can automate our codes, as they come ready to solve certain problems.
<p> Therefore, libraries can be part of a framework, never the other way around.
<br>

# __Text Two__
<br>
<p> The second text is also easy to read, it reminded me of some articles in my area of ​​training, when CI emerged with the informational boom that occurred after World War II and that had the internet as a facilitator in this sense.
<p> In addition to the text, we can learn how the internet works with the help of two videos available on the page, in the active learning section.
<p> Getting into the topic: internet, the text summarizes how the structure, or connection, which we usually call a network, is constructed, starting with the example of the connection between some computers on a small scale and the way in which a solution was thought already existing in telephony.
<p>From the internet connection it could carry messages with the help of the built network and also with the definition of some criteria for this, such as the addresses of both the sender and the receiver of the information through a service that works on this structure, known like web.
<p>In addition to the internet that we always talk about, there is an intranet and an extranet, the first works practically the same way, but with restricted access, usually used in organizations, while the second is also private but opens to some users, or other organizations, for example.
<br> 

# __Text Three__
<br>
<p>The third and last text, no less important than the others, brings another important topic for programming, or technology. Who hasn't heard of algorithm? Nowadays it is easy to hear that the algorithm of such a social network promoted some recommendations, posts, related to mkt, and even certain subjects..
<p>In this sense, the text makes clear what this "Algorithm" is, which is nothing more than instructions, that's right, as an example it was easy to imagine the recipe to make a cake, and with that to realize that even human beings can work through of these instructions.
<p>In addition to the explanation, it is possible to verify algorithms in the flowchart version, where each element describes, in addition to the steps that must be taken, the way in which each step takes place, that is, inputs, outputs and possible conditions. portugol also shows how instructions can be passed by building the sequence of actions in structured portuguese.
<p>With this we can see that the algorithms can be written in several ways, in addition, the structures created can be replaced by a programming language, using the logic present in these instructions.# semana1---GitEGithub
